R markdown files associated with the manuscript "Haploid gynogens facilitate disomic marker development in paleotetraploid sturgeons."
Description of files:
1. HaploidGenomicReference.Rmd: R markdown for production of reduced-representation genomic reference from haploid sturgeon + identification of paralogous sequence variants in haploids.
2. DiploidSNPProcessing.Rmd: R markdown for demultiplexing diploid sturgeon reads, mapping reads to haploid reference, calling SNPs, filtering SNPs, and haplotyping SNPs.
3. SpeciesDiscrimination.Rmd: R markdown for performing DAPC and PCA on the genomic and microsatellite datasets.
